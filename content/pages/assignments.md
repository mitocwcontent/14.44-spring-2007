This section features the course's problem sets and their solutions. Problem Set 1 is omitted because it was intended for students who did not meet the prerequisite for the course.

Problem sets 3-7 were written by Professor Paul Joskow.  Problem set 2 was written by the course TA, Arthur Campbell, and is used here with permission.  Solutions are also courtesy of Arthur Campbell and are also used here with permission. Please note: solutions are not available for all problem sets.
